Name: Load Balancer with HAProxy for Chef Server (RightLink 10)
Description: "Load Balancer with HAProxy for Chef Server ServerTemplate.   RightLink10
  is a new agent to connect servers to the RightScale platform that is very lightweight
  and simple to install.\r\n_It is not a plug-in upgrade from the older RightLink
  v6 series._\r\nSee [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.\r\n\r\nIn addition to installing HAProxy, this ServerTemplate runs
  a script to update the packaging system and enable automatic security updates, and
  a collectd install script to enable RightScale monitoring. \r\n\r\nThe ServerTemplate
  can run on most any Linux distro that supports cloud-init. It is recommended to
  use the standard distro images in various clouds.\r\n\r\n__ Requirements__\r\n\r\n
  * Chef Server or Hosted Chef\r\n * [rs-haproxy](https://github.com/rightscale-cookbooks/rs-haproxy)
  ([1.2.0](https://github.com/rightscale-cookbooks/rs-haproxy/releases/tag/v1.2.0))\r\n\r\n__Key
  Features:__\r\n\r\n * Downloads source code, builds, and installs HAProxy and configures
  the server to act as the front-end for all HTTP(S) requests.\r\n * Recipe to attach
  existing application servers in the deployment.\r\n * Recipe to set up load balancer
  machine tags on the server.\r\n * Monitoring HAProxy process.\r\n * Basic set of
  recipes for a RightLink-based server with logging, monitoring, alerts, tagging,
  etc.\r\n * MultiCloud Images that reference the latest supported images with a frozen
  and tested software repository date.\r\n * Basic set of alerts for most server type
  monitoring.\r\n * Examples of system-required input variables.\r\n\r\n__Documentation:__

Alerts:
  - Name: rs instance terminated
    Description: Raise an alert if the instance has been terminated abnormally, i.e.
      not through the RightScale interface or by an elasticity daemon resizing server
      arrays.
    Clause: If RS/server.state == terminated for 1 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs instance stranded
    Description: Raise an alert if the instance enters the stranded state.
    Clause: If RS/server-failure.state == stranded for 1 minutes Then escalate warning
  - Name: rs instance not responding
    Description: Raise an alert if the instance fails to send monitoring information
      for 5 minutes.
    Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value == NaN for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs cpu busy
    Description: Raise an alert if the idle time is too low.
    Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 15 for 3 minutes Then escalate warning
  - Name: rs cpu overloaded
    Description: Raise an alert when the cpu idle time is too low.
    Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 3 for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs cpu I/O wait
    Description: Raise an alert if disk io is too high.
    Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-wait.value > 40 for 15 minutes Then escalate warning
  - Name: rs low space in root partition
    Description: Raise an alert if the available space in the root partition is too low. This alert may be modified on

      Linux Setup Alerts RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh) for more details.
    Clause: If df-root/df_complex-free.value < 1073741824 for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs high network tx activity
    Description: Raise an alert if the amount of network data transmitted is too high. This alert may be modified or
      cloned on an instance to match the actual network interfaces that are present. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts
      RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh) for more details.
    Clause: If interface-eth0/if_octets.tx > 10000000 for 10 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs high network rx activity
    Description: Raise an alert if the amount of network data received is too high. This alert may be modified or cloned
      on an instance to match the actual network interfaces that are present. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts
      RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh) for more details.
